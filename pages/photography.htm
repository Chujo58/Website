    During my Fall 2021 semester, I took a photography class. Some of the
    pictures
    seen in the gallery bellow were taken during that class with a <a

        href="https://en.nikon.ca/nikon-products/product-archive/dslr-cameras/d70s.html">D70s</a>
    Nikon camera body. Over the semester, different projects took place for us
    to
    learn more about photography and to also apply the skills we had learned in
    class about Photoshop.

    Since then, I have taken some more pictures of the night sky and also of my
    cat, since she likes to be taken in picture very much, with my new <a

        href="https://en.nikon.ca/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-5.html">Z5</a>
    Nikon camera body. Some of the pictures below were taken with an old F50
    Nikon film camera.
