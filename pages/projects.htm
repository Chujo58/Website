            <p>
                This project first started during the summer of 2022. The
                original
                code
                was made to read data from ROOT files created by the <a

                software by
                CAEN.

            <p>
                Over the course of the summer, I reshaped the code to a GUI,
                avoiding editing filepaths to read the data. The first release
                of
                the GUI was very barebones but capable of reading the
                information
                saved by CoMPASS in data acquisition folders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first release was only available on Github at the time and
                installing the code wasn't super easy, especially when I was
                often
                updating the code at the time. The library was then published to
                <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ReadROOT/" target="_blank"
                    class="box-link">PyPI</a> to simplify installations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second release, and current release, has updated looks and
                updated plotting functions, allowing the GUI to recreate any
                plot
                CoMPASS can create. This second release was created over the
                summer
                of 2023 and is still under development.

                This is the second version of my portfolio. The original website
                was made in 2022 and a few revisions were made to add
                photography pictures and other coding projects. After taking a
                Web Development course at McGill, I thought it best to revisit
                this website and recreate it using new skills learned
                throughtout the course.

                I first started this project in October 2022. The main part of
                this project was a web scrapper to get information straight from
                a fan made <a
                    href="https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Stigmata"
                    target="_blank" class="box-link">Wiki</a> for the game
                Honkai Impact 3rd. The data from the website was saved in memory
                never in an actual file to be able to reparse and update the
                data whenever needed. This bot stayed online until November
                2023, after another update of the Wiki.
