            This project first started during the summer of 2022. The original
            code
            was made to read data from ROOT files created by the <a

                class="box-link"
                href="https://www.caen.it/products/compass/">CoMPASS</a>
            software by
            CAEN.

            Over the course of the summer, I reshaped the code to a GUI,
            avoiding editing filepaths to read the data. The first release of
            the GUI was very barebones but capable of reading the information
            saved by CoMPASS in data acquisition folders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first release was only available on Github at the time and
            installing the code wasn't super easy, especially when I was often
            updating the code at the time. The library was then published to
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ReadROOT/" target="_blank"
                class="box-link">PyPI</a> to simplify installations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second release, and current release, has updated looks and
            updated plotting functions, allowing the GUI to recreate any plot
            CoMPASS can create. This second release was created over the summer
            of 2023 and is still under development.
